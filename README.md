### Docker Terminal Utilities

Needs to be placed in /usr/local/bin and renamed dku before these commands can be used:
- Enter container bash shell: dku bash [CONTAINER NAME/ID]
- Enter container sh shell: dku sh  [CONTAINER NAME/ID]
- Print container's docker IP/bound ports (leave name/id blank to see all containers] : dku net [CONTAINER NAME/ID]
